# Hello there!
My name is James, but I also go by my handle, jazo (jay-zo). I frequently develop in Python, but my passion is for AWS Infrastructure & DevSecOps engineering, with most of my coding in Terraform HCL, YAML and Bash. When I'm not working on a new project or GitHub Actions workflow, I'm usually optimizing or updating containers for development or Kubernetes deployment. 

## IaC, Containerization, Orchestration & CI/CD
- 1000s of lines of HCL (Terraform) live resource provisioning
  - From VPC, networks & IAM permissions to serverless, managed and unmanaged resources
  - Modules for reusable code
  - Remote states for sharing resources across projects or repos
  - State-locking for team provisioning
- Docker
  - Container migrations
  - Commandline troubleshooting
  - Reverse proxy configurations
  - APIs
- Kubernetes
  - Helm orchestration
  - Commandline troubleshooting
  - Deployment, service, ingress management
  - App migrations
- GitHub Actions
  - Automated testing
  - Enhanced security with ephemeral credentials
  - Semantic versioning
  - Matrices
  - Reporting
